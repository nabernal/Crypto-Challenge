# Cryptocurrencies Challenge

## Overview: 

#### Created a report listing cryptocurrencies currently being traded in the market. A classification system was developed using the K-means algorithm for easy grouping based on a currency's coin supply and mining amount. The report can be presented to investment banks looking to offer investment portfolios on cryptocurrencies.  

## Visualizations:

#### 1. Elbow Curve

#### 2. 3D Scatter Plot

#### 3. Hvplot Table

#### 4. 2D Scatter Plot

## Summary: 

#### The original dataset contained 1,245 coins. Rows with null values and coins that were not being traded were removed from the dataset. The clean dataset contains a total of 531 coins. The Elbow Curve helped determine the number of clusters into which the coins would be sorted. The 3D Scatter Plot shows the classification of each currency based on the Principal Component Analysis we ran. The HvPlot table provides a list of each coin and its features. The final graph, a 2D Scatter Plot, shows the four clusters based on their supply and mining amount.
